## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.fortrisk.com)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.bienfacture.com)

Used **Python** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
